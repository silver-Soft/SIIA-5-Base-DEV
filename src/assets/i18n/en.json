In some cases it will be a bit difficult for you to decide which activity you like best, because all three will seem equally pleasant or unpleasant. However, it is essential that you choose among them the one that you would like more and the one that you would like less.

When answering, obey your first impulse and move on. Of course, it is completely useless to consult with someone about what to choose. An answer that is not your own is totally worthless.
